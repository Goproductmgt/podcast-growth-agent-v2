[00:00:00] Just a couple other ones that my kids reminded me of.
[00:00:03] Every year since they were little, Gib makes candy cane pancakes on Christmas Eve breakfast.
[00:00:11] Oh my gosh, what is a candy cane pancake?
[00:00:14] So Gib would make pancakes, but he'd give Ziploc baggies of little candy canes to the kids.
[00:00:21] Yeah.
[00:00:21] To chop.
[00:00:22] Yeah.
[00:00:23] Smash them up, yep.
[00:00:24] Smash them up.
[00:00:25] And then think of Elf, you know, syrup, candy canes.
[00:00:30] This year, we'll hopefully do it again.
[00:00:32] And then Christmas morning, I always make quiche.
[00:00:36] Oh, yum.
[00:00:37] Kind of when we're up and we're just all gathering.
[00:00:40] Yeah.
[00:00:41] I just, I'm up early, but then it goes in the oven and you can smell it while we're just saying good morning and stuff.
[00:00:48] So those are two things, just the four plus Marianne, because she's usually with us.
[00:00:53] we've enjoyed. Nice. For as long as I can remember.

[00:01:31] one step, one room, and one habit at a time. Hey, Redesigning Health and Home family,
[00:01:37] it's Carrie and Meg, and we are so happy that you're joining us today. Today is holiday food
[00:01:44] recipes. We're so excited. We are so excited. Anytime food, but holiday food, nothing better.
[00:01:52] Absolutely. And we had some submissions from some of our listeners that we're so excited to share.
[00:01:58] And if you stick around to the end, we'll actually share how you can get a copy of,
[00:02:03] well, it's a virtual copy of our digital cookbook that we're going to share with everybody's
[00:02:08] recipes today. So you don't have to worry about trying to write anything down. We got you covered.
[00:02:13] Stay to the end and we'll tell you how to get your hands on that.
[00:02:17] Yes, Carrie figured out a wonderful way how to take these, some handwritten submissions.
[00:02:24] And we going to put it into a fun project Yes absolutely But I was thinking Meg that you been at your new home for two months now Is that true In about two months
[00:02:35] Yes, exactly.
[00:02:36] And how's it going?
[00:02:38] We're enjoying it.
[00:02:39] I mean, it's so, so pretty here.
[00:02:41] And the fall is, I've never seen such a beautiful background and scenery with the leaves and these beautiful trees and the water that surrounds us.
[00:02:51] So we're very, very blessed and lucky to be here.
[00:02:54] So, yeah.
[00:02:55] So, so far, so good.
[00:02:56] I hear you're getting snow.
[00:02:58] We are getting.
[00:02:59] We got snow overnight.
[00:03:01] We did get snow.
[00:03:02] Wow.
[00:03:03] Wow.
[00:03:04] Yes.
[00:03:05] Yes.
[00:03:05] So, and I think they got even more snow downtown by the lake.
[00:03:09] Okay.
[00:03:10] Well, I was talking to my kids.
[00:03:11] They're going to the Bears game today.
[00:03:13] And, of course, the day my sweet daughter said, oh, my gosh, I'm going to triple up on pants and get really warm.
[00:03:21] but maybe it'll be a super fun snowball, you know?
[00:03:25] Yeah.
[00:03:25] Yeah.
[00:03:26] I think that when you live in a place like Chicago,
[00:03:29] you just have to embrace it.
[00:03:30] You know, we're going to layer up and go and enjoy that game.
[00:03:34] So yeah, I hope they have a great time together.
[00:03:36] I hope they do too.
[00:03:38] That's so great.
[00:03:39] What a great thing for them to do together.
[00:03:41] So absolutely.
[00:03:42] I was thinking of you though,
[00:03:44] because when you left Washington,
[00:03:46] you had to leave behind all your clients
[00:03:49] in your classes that you were teaching, your fitness classes.
[00:03:52] And so now that you're in, you guys, you live kind of remote.
[00:03:57] So what's happening with that?
[00:03:59] You know, are you able to kind of keep that going at all?
[00:04:02] I totally am.
[00:04:03] I feel really lucky.
[00:04:05] I mean, I have my YouTube and that's so much fun, you know, and then I have a few clients
[00:04:10] one-on-one, all virtual, which has been working out beautifully.
[00:04:14] Oh, awesome.
[00:04:15] Some I've had pretty much since COVID, and they just always wanted to stay virtual.
[00:04:22] And then one of my old establishments was just so gracious when I moved to keep a class, and they went virtual for me.
[00:04:29] So, yeah, it's good.
[00:04:31] It's given me a little bit of that still another type of community, along with redesigning health and home and my FitFed community, too.
[00:04:39] Thank you.
[00:04:40] Right, right.
[00:04:40] Well, just another great perk of having this technology at our fingertips to be able to do that.
[00:04:48] Amazing perk. Yes.
[00:04:50] Yeah. Oh, that's so cool.
[00:04:52] Yeah.
[00:04:52] Well we going to get into the recipe submissions that we got today And it occurred to me that being from Canada I have quite a few submissions from some friends and family from Canada and that we kind of do
[00:05:08] have a few holiday things that I think are specific to Canadians. You'll have to let me
[00:05:14] know if you've heard of any of these. So if you don't mind, I was going to just share a few of
[00:05:18] them and see if you've heard of them. I can't wait to hear. Go for it. Okay. So the first one
[00:05:23] is called Nanaimo Bars.
[00:05:26] Have you heard of Nanaimo Bars?
[00:05:28] Never.
[00:05:30] Okay, so Nanaimo Bars,
[00:05:32] I'm going to read this,
[00:05:33] you're going to see me reading here.
[00:05:35] It is a bar dessert that requires no baking,
[00:05:38] which is awesome.
[00:05:39] It's named after the Canadian city Nanaimo,
[00:05:42] which is in British Columbia,
[00:05:43] and it has three layers,
[00:05:46] a wafer nut coconut crumb base,
[00:05:49] a custard icing in the middle,
[00:05:51] and a layer of chocolate ganache on the top.
[00:05:54] And it is heavenly.
[00:05:57] It's so good.
[00:05:59] My mom used to make it all the time.
[00:06:02] And it's funny, I asked my sister Deb,
[00:06:04] do you make Nanaimo bars?
[00:06:06] And she's like, no, because the ingredients are expensive.
[00:06:10] I was like, oh, really?
[00:06:11] I hadn't thought about that.
[00:06:12] Why are they called Nanaimo bars?
[00:06:15] So I guess it's just named after the town
[00:06:17] where they kind of originated.
[00:06:19] Oh, so cool.
[00:06:20] Yeah, isn't that cool?
[00:06:22] Yeah.
[00:06:22] So, okay, here's the second one.
[00:06:24] Butter tarts.
[00:06:26] Have you heard of them?
[00:06:28] I've not heard of butter tarts, but maybe once you say what it is, it'll sound familiar.
[00:06:34] Yeah, so it's a very traditional Canadian thing.
[00:06:38] So it's a butter tart.
[00:06:40] It's a small pastry.
[00:06:41] So it's a tart, like in a tart shell.
[00:06:43] It says, highly regarded in Canadian cuisine.
[00:06:46] The sweet tart consists of a filling of butter, sugar, syrup, and egg baked in a pastry shell until the filling is semi-solid with a crunchy top.
[00:07:00] Is this similar to a flan?
[00:07:04] No.
[00:07:05] It is definitely a tart.
[00:07:06] So if you, the closest I can think of is if you have pecan pie or a pecan tart.
[00:07:13] Okay.
[00:07:14] And you put pecans out.
[00:07:15] it's kind of like that
[00:07:17] I see
[00:07:19] oh that sounds sweet and delicious
[00:07:21] yes and some people add raisins
[00:07:23] in but that a hot button because some people are like do not come near my butter tart with your raisins and then other people are like oh I love the raisins So that a bit of a hot button there So Okay And then have you ever heard of a dainty tray
[00:07:42] A dainty tray? Well, okay. I'm picturing something very demure, cute little pastries
[00:07:50] on a tray? Yes, you're pretty much right. So a dainty tray is a variety of fancy cookies,
[00:07:58] pastries, or squares. So it's very common for somebody in Canada to say,
[00:08:04] oh, I'll bring a dainty tray to the party. And they just mean I'm going to bring in an assortment
[00:08:10] of desserts. And they're all kind of little bite size usually. Yeah. Yeah. But I think that's a
[00:08:17] British inspiration there. An assortment of treats on a tray. Yeah, like little cookies and bars and
[00:08:25] squares and yummy things like that. I might have to borrow that, a dainty tray. A dainty tray.
[00:08:31] And then, well, I already know that you know this one. So pierogies and cabbage rolls,
[00:08:39] because there's a very large Ukrainian influence in Canada. And so that quite often makes it
[00:08:45] onto people's tables. And my mom made such great cabbage rolls. It was so good. So yeah,
[00:08:51] that's something that's quite often on our table as well. Okay. So my Bubby, my grandma,
[00:08:57] and my mom made cabbage rolls. The kids love them. They were called glumpki.
[00:09:06] Really? Glumpki. Now tell me about your cabbage rolls. Is it in a tomato sauce?
[00:09:12] tomato sauce and i think there's usually um ground beef in there yeah and rice oh yes yes yes that's
[00:09:20] true in the cabbage roll oh yes i forgot about that yes i've never made them they look very
[00:09:26] difficult to make are they well the cat you have to soften all the cabbage right right so it will
[00:09:33] roll right sure and then you toothpick them and then mouth is watering carry jane's cabbage roll
[00:09:43] So good.
[00:09:44] Yes, with a little dollop of sour cream on top.
[00:09:46] Yes, yes.
[00:09:48] And I don't know any other name for cabbage rolls, but I do remember Pete's Baba calling pierogies petahe.
[00:09:59] Petahe?
[00:10:00] Etahe.
[00:10:00] Etahe.
[00:10:01] So there you go.
[00:10:02] Okay.
[00:10:02] Okay.
[00:10:03] So I always thought they were Polish, but you're saying Ukrainian.
[00:10:09] Well, here's the interesting thing.
[00:10:10] So those countries are very close.
[00:10:12] So I think that the influence is, you know, goes across the border.
[00:10:15] Yes.
[00:10:15] So our last name, people automatically assume it's Polish because it has S-K-I at the end.
[00:10:23] So, and it does sound Polish, right?
[00:10:25] But Pete's Baba was Ukrainian.
[00:10:27] So.
[00:10:27] Oh, okay.
[00:10:29] 
[00:10:29] Okay.
[00:10:30] Yes, cabbage rolls. That sounds so good. Glumpkin.
[00:10:34] Glumpkin.
[00:10:36] Yum.
[00:10:37] Yes, yes.
[00:10:38] I'm hungry.
[00:10:39] What else do you have?
[00:10:41] So now we're going to share the recipes that were sent to us.
[00:10:45] Yeah.
[00:10:46] Do you want to go first or do you want me to go first?
[00:10:48] You go for it. I love this.
[00:10:50] Okay.
[00:10:50] so the first one came from my sister deb and um she shared dad's nuts and bolts and so here's the
[00:11:01] story behind it dad used to make these for craft sales every holiday season i've adapted the recipe
[00:11:08] a bit mostly to cut down on the salt his version had a all caps lot of salt i found this version
[00:11:16] online a few years ago, and it's become our go-to ever since. Still salty, but not quite as much as
[00:11:23] Dad's. And I have to ask you, I thought, oh, this word would have been perfect for our pronunciation
[00:11:29] debate. Okay. I'll spell it, and then you tell me how you pronounce it. Okay. Pronounce it.
[00:11:35] W-O-R-C-E-S-T-E-R-S-H-I-R-E.
[00:11:43] Worcestershire, shire, shire, shire.
[00:11:45] Right.
[00:11:47] Worcestershire?
[00:11:49] So I actually had to go online to get the pronunciation.
[00:11:53] And the one that I found that seemed easiest was Worcestershire.
[00:11:59] Worcestershire.
[00:12:00] Okay, that makes sense now.
[00:12:01] That sounds right.
[00:12:02] Worcestershire.
[00:12:03] But if you look at that word, it looks like there's a lot more syllables than that.
[00:12:07] Yes, yes.
[00:12:08] But that's one of the ingredients.
[00:12:10] And then it's butter, seasonings, cereals, and salty snacks like pretzels, bugles, and Ritzbitz, which I don't know if those are Canadian or not.
[00:12:18] Now, when are you having nuts and bolts?
[00:12:21] Is this just in a tray somewhere?
[00:12:23] Yeah this is in a bowl for a movie night It you know Christmas Eve you might have just a bowl a little snacky bowl out but also bagged up with a little ribbon on the top It a cute gift
[00:12:35] Oh, cute.
[00:12:35] It's a cute gift as well, too.
[00:12:37] Very sweet.
[00:12:38] Thanks, Deb.
[00:12:40] Yeah, Dad's nuts and bolts.
[00:12:41] I like it.
[00:12:42] I like it.
[00:12:44] All right.
[00:12:46] So my brother Adam had a nice memory.
[00:12:49] Well, and this was even when I was speaking to my daughter and my husband.
[00:12:54] and me and my family my mom's stuffing but the story adam wanted to share was when we
[00:13:02] were little people used dried bag croutons almost for the stuffing well my mom would
[00:13:13] toast white bread in a toaster you know two slices at a time really and we when we were
[00:13:21] little would run around the kitchen this was always the night before thanksgiving because it
[00:13:25] needed to dry out a little bit yeah she would toast the bread and we would run around and as
[00:13:31] soon as it popped up we'd pull it out of the toaster and you'd have to rip it up into chunks
[00:13:37] so they were all different shapes and then my mom would have this amazing huge bowl of bread dried
[00:13:44] out then in a little bit and she'd start the stuffing that way but this bread toasting and
[00:13:51] ripping has since little right when my mom stopped making stuffing I mean she made it forever then I
[00:14:01] took over and I remember just wanting to make it taste exactly the same way so my kids then would
[00:14:10] just rip up the bread and very cute. So he, he right away called and said, I said, Hey, what's
[00:14:16] up? He said, well, I'm calling about the recipe request. And I said, Oh, thank you so much. So
[00:14:23] he, he shared that story and it just, Oh gosh, it flew me right back to when I was a little girl.
[00:14:31] Yes. Yes. And homemade breadcrumbs. I love that.
[00:14:35] homemade breadcrumbs yeah yeah because i remember you could go to the store and buy just a bag of
[00:14:41] crumbled up breadcrumbs but yeah you're your mom actually and you make them yourself yeah yeah so
[00:14:48] super fun yes never oh yeah i know there was the stovetop which has its place and is delicious and
[00:14:54] you can use it in so many but mom definitely had her stuffing recipe Yes yes Well I hope you going to share that That going to be in our virtual
[00:15:05] Yeah.
[00:15:06] Okay, great.
[00:15:07] Great.
[00:15:08] Well, this submission came from Lindsay, my niece Lindsay, and this was her response to my request.
[00:15:17] I have been pondering the recipe tradition question.
[00:15:20] question. I have been pondering the recipe tradition question and I'm coming up dry.
[00:15:27] My kids hate traditional Christmas dinner. So years ago, I gave up on that and each year
[00:15:33] they give me a new culinary challenge. Year one was authentic Vietnamese pho. The broth took me
[00:15:41] days but was, quote, better than the restaurant, which was high praise from the kids. Our only
[00:15:47] other holiday meal tradition is to make a bunch of random Costco appetizer things for Christmas
[00:15:53] Eve dinner. Think all the yummy frozen things like coconut shrimp, spring rolls, and taquitos.
[00:15:59] That's great.
[00:16:01] Yep. So no specific recipe there, but just what their family has adopted.
[00:16:05] But how fun, right? Just to explore something new every year. That's kind of fun.
[00:16:11] Yes. It actually reminded me, this story is funny and also a little bit sad,
[00:16:17] So we were living in Rochester at the time, and we were going to my sister Barb's house for Christmas.
[00:16:23] So excited.
[00:16:25] They live in Indiana, and we were driving there, and we were about 45 minutes out.
[00:16:29] It was quite a long drive.
[00:16:31] And she called, and she tested positive for COVID.
[00:16:35] So we did not stay there.
[00:16:38] So we ended up driving to Chicago, which is where our eldest daughter lived at the time.
[00:16:44] and she was sharing an apartment with her girlfriend. Luckily, her girlfriend had gone
[00:16:49] home for Christmas. But we pulled into town Christmas Eve, day, minutes before Trader Joe's
[00:16:58] was about to close. So we gave them a credit card and we said, go just get whatever, you know,
[00:17:03] whatever looks good. And so they did. And it was the most random Christmas dinner. It was just like,
[00:17:10] you know yeah just all this random you know appetizer stuff but it created this great story
[00:17:17] right that is marvelous that a great story i bet they remember that so much too yeah yeah it was a very different christmas and of course we were sad that we missed out on the Christmas And my sister Barb had been preparing for weeks ahead of time She like
[00:17:36] what am I going to do with all this food? And you know, so it was bittersweet, I would say.
[00:17:42] You know, life throws us curveballs. And it sounds like you made the best of it. And yeah,
[00:17:49] Well, very good.
[00:17:51] So what's next in your list?
[00:17:54] So our wonderful listener and friend Katie sent in a very sweet note.
[00:18:00] Yeah, hi, Katie.
[00:18:01] She sent in a very sweet note.
[00:18:03] So I'll just read her note and then we'll, of course, put her recipes into our virtual cookbook.
[00:18:09] So she says.
[00:18:11] she says i own two crock pots and sometimes i think i need a third exclamation exclamation
[00:18:26] which i understand that when the adult kids come home for the holidays i love keeping the crock
[00:18:31] pots going here are two favorite recipes easy the meatballs we enjoy on new year's eve and again on
[00:18:38] Super Bowl Sunday. The chicken and rice is an easy to make crowd pleaser, a filling dinner,
[00:18:45] and love Katie. So and yeah, she sent two very nice recipe cards with those cocktail meatballs
[00:18:52] with cranberry sauce. Sounds very festive. And then her crackpot chicken and rice. So
[00:18:59] we will definitely share those. Thank you. Thank you, Katie.
[00:19:01] Yes, thank you, Katie. And actually, that brings me to my friend Lori then, because she's
[00:19:08] submitted a recipe that I'm actually changing the name a bit to We Little Meatballs because she said
[00:19:15] the key to these is to make the meatballs very small so that they are, you know, kind of appetizer
[00:19:21] size. And I make a sweet and sour meatball dish that's similar, but Lori's is a little different
[00:19:29] because her meatballs are coated in breadcrumbs. And she shares, we had a Christmas supper, not at
[00:19:37] our home, but at a friend's home, and these delicious meatballs were served. We got her
[00:19:42] recipe, and now we have it ourselves every Christmas. One of Daryl's favorites, We Little Balls.
[00:19:52] So I'm curious to see how similar they are. The cranberry sauce sounds a little bit different,
[00:19:58] but I think they're...
[00:20:00] There is grape jelly in this recipe.
[00:20:02] Okay.
[00:20:03] Yes.
[00:20:04] Very fun.
[00:20:05] Now, did she say these are just an appetizer?
[00:20:10] Yeah, it sounds like, yeah, like the little small, you know, I'm imagining toothpicks or, you know, a few on your appy plate.
[00:20:18] I guess it could be served with dinner too, though, right?
[00:20:21] That sounds great.
[00:20:22] Well, speaking of meatballs, we make Swedish meatballs every year for Christmas Eve.
[00:20:28] Oh, okay.
[00:20:29] Because Gibbs' mom made amazing Swedish meatballs, and these go to our Christmas Eve festivities.
[00:20:37] And that Christmas Eve on Gibbs' side is a cocktail party.
[00:20:42] Everybody brings two or three appetizers every Christmas Eve.
[00:20:47] Everyone's so excited to see what people are bringing.
[00:20:50] And most of it's the same every year.
[00:20:52] Yes.
[00:20:53] With a few new things.
[00:20:54] But the Swedish meatballs, oh, they just are a taste of home.
[00:20:59] So we do do meatballs, too.
[00:21:02] So question about Swedish meatballs, because I'm thinking IKEA.
[00:21:06] Swedish meatballs.
[00:21:08] And those, so what's the difference?
[00:21:10] Are they more gravy?
[00:21:12] Well, the ones that we make, we do not make a sauce with them.
[00:21:16] Oh, okay.
[00:21:17] I think you obviously could and serve them.
[00:21:21] But these are just, what's interesting about them is the seasoning or the spices are all spice.
[00:21:29] Oh.
[00:21:30] Little nutmeg.
[00:21:31] Okay.
[00:21:32] So they have this warmth behind the flavor.
[00:21:37] Right.
[00:21:38] And just, again, little.
[00:21:40] I think his mom used to fry them in a pan with some butter.
[00:21:45] I've made an edit too where I make the little balls or whoever's helping, you know, Gibbs, wonderful great aunt is usually with us over Christmas and she helps put it together.
[00:21:58] But we make the little balls on a cookie tray and then bake them.
[00:22:03] Oh, yeah.
[00:22:03] And if you just, I remember Gibbs mom once when I think I first made them years, years, years ago, she tasted one and it needed more seasoning.
[00:22:15] So she was so sweet.
[00:22:16] So when they came out of the oven, I think I did them in the oven that time.
[00:22:19] She just took the allspice and kind of dusted on the top while they were still warm.
[00:22:24] And then a little seasoning salt They were amazing So yes that the meatball situation continues for us too Yes Wow That quite a few meatball dishes that we going to be sharing
[00:22:36] Yeah. So fun.
[00:22:39] Well, Sue, who was one of our guests on the show, also submitted. So she submitted a popcorn ball
[00:22:45] recipe, but also one called, are you ready for this? Pumpkin gingerbread with caramel sauce.
[00:22:52] like does that not sound i can't wait to hear this because what i'm picturing i first pictured
[00:23:00] a caramel glaze but then i thought maybe it's like warm or something yeah after your slice
[00:23:09] tell me well let me tell you the story she gave behind it she said one christmas our family was
[00:23:17] scattered and we had Christmas with friends. She served this cake. The following Christmas,
[00:23:22] I served it and now it's an annual request. My dad loved it. Now that he's gone, I remember the
[00:23:29] way he reacted with the first taste. It makes me feel close to him when he's no longer at our table.
[00:23:36] Right? Sweet. So sweet. So sweet. And she says, the pumpkin gingerbread cake was all a smell
[00:23:47] pumpkin, ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, then the sweetness of warm caramel. So that sounds so good.
[00:23:54] So it gives the recipe for the pumpkin gingerbread cake part. And then it says butter, corn syrup,
[00:24:02] brown sugar, and whipping cream. Really? Oh, that sounds decadent. That really does. Okay,
[00:24:10] so it is served with the sauce on the side. Or maybe drizzled on the top.
[00:24:16] Yeah.
[00:24:18] Sounds amazing.
[00:24:20] Gosh, yes.
[00:24:21] Thank you, Sue.
[00:24:22] Yeah, sounds decadent.
[00:24:24] It does.
[00:24:25] It does.
[00:24:25] Well, I am going to go to Trisha.
[00:24:29] And Trisha emailed us.
[00:24:30] So thank you so much.
[00:24:32] She says, hi, Carrie and Meg.
[00:24:34] Plum dumplings.
[00:24:36] Now, plum dumplings.
[00:24:38] This goes back again to Bubby.
[00:24:40] My Bubby.
[00:24:41] My Bubby.
[00:24:43] I can see in her...
[00:24:46] cute little bungalow house making these, you know, with my family. And now she says,
[00:24:53] this was my Bubby recipe that she made on occasion during the year Mom my mom my sister mom and I have made them for Christmas as a side dish every year And we always make extra that are not cooked And we give a few to
[00:25:10] each of the families that are there because everybody wants more. Right. And they, Tricia
[00:25:18] then has now since asked my daughter her daughter for you know sometimes people get together that
[00:25:25] to make ravioli or the pierogi making day we have a plum dumpling making day and trisha scours the
[00:25:36] grocery stores for when the little italian plums are available they're very hard to find okay they
[00:25:43] have a pit but there are you can make them with strawberries or we sometimes have blue made them
[00:25:48] with blueberries they're very yummy so you boil the dumpling once they're kind of put together
[00:25:54] yeah ricotta cheese all the yummy good stuff just to make this soft dough right fill them and then
[00:26:05] you boil the dumpling okay but then you take the boiled dumplings to your gathering and you cut
[00:26:13] them in maybe eight and you pan fry them in butter so they get a little crispy and buttery
[00:26:23] and sometimes you will sprinkle powdered sugar on top so they can be a sweet side as well as a savory
[00:26:31] side so yes that is a family favorite so is the fruit inside the dumpling it is inside the dumpling
[00:26:39] Oh my gosh.
[00:26:41] And the first few of the year are a mess because you dump it into the boiling water and it all falls apart.
[00:26:50] So you have the dough is very tender, gentle.
[00:26:55] You have to make sure the consistency is just right to hold the dumpling or the hold the plum inside.
[00:27:05] Sure.
[00:27:05] Or the blueberries or strawberries or people do peaches, whatever.
[00:27:09] yeah they're so good and they're at Christmas time. That sounds really amazing. And she sent
[00:27:17] one more and that was for New Year's Eve and Katie mentioned New Year's Eve for her meatballs. So
[00:27:23] this was New Year Eve She said we come together to prepare dinner It usually her kids and any significant others And they start making it all together at three and it beef Wellington on New Year Eve And
[00:27:38] she said, and they want it to be ready around 7 p.m. to eat. The recipe is followed and they have
[00:27:45] the side, usually mashed potatoes, which is her husband's dad's recipe. So a lot of family
[00:27:52] traditions with these. Definitely. And she attached the beef wellington recipe that she uses.
[00:27:59] So we'll definitely share that as well. Oh, wonderful. That sounds so delicious. Thank you,
[00:28:05] Tricia, for sharing those. That's so wonderful. So Tricia's recipes lead right into the next ones
[00:28:11] that I was going to talk about. So you were mentioning about how the dough was quite delicate.
[00:28:16] So my friend Tina, she's sharing a pierogi recipe.
[00:28:21] So pierogies are very common to find on the table in Canada, as I mentioned.
[00:28:26] They're hard to make.
[00:28:27] So I know this because Pete's Bob had tried to teach me.
[00:28:31] And if you don't pinch them all the way closed and you put them in the boiling water,
[00:28:35] your potatoes and your cheese are just going to end up floating in the water.
[00:28:38] So you can buy pierogies if you don't want to make, you can buy frozen pierogies.
[00:28:43] What's special about Tina's recipe?
[00:28:45] is it has butter, sour cream, heavy cream, and dill in it. And so she said, this is a not good
[00:28:52] for you at all recipe that we enjoy as a side dish at holiday dinners. To make it gluten-free,
[00:28:58] you would just have to substitute the pergis for gluten-free ones. Otherwise, everything else
[00:29:03] is gluten-free. She says, it was a recipe my aunt brought to Christmas dinner, and it was a huge hit,
[00:29:09] so now it has been on the menu for every family get-together. So that's Tina's
[00:29:15] submission with her perigee recipe. And she says dill is optional. And I'm thinking,
[00:29:20] load up that dill. I love dill. Do you like dill?
[00:29:23] Yeah, you were telling me about that dill cream sauce. And let us say, again, these are holiday
[00:29:28] dishes. Yes.
[00:29:30] Moderation. You know, this is once, twice a year. Yes.
[00:29:34] We talk about all our decadent, lovely, wonderful food. So, yes.
[00:29:39] Yes. Yes. This is not to eat every single day, for sure.
[00:29:43] Well, and actually that leads right into Lori W. So there's two Lorries today. This is Lori W. This recipe is named after the woman who developed it, Hazel Hermes.
[00:29:59] Hermes.
[00:30:00] terms maybe so laurie shares this recipe called hazel hermes so she said this recipe has been
[00:30:08] part of our thanksgiving since i married john it was a recipe that his mother made for thanksgiving
[00:30:14] each year i continued the tradition it is basically loaded mashed potatoes it tastes
[00:30:20] great with or without gravy and can be made days ahead i did not find out until many years later
[00:30:27] that Hazel was actually a neighbor of John's parents in their early years of living in Arlington
[00:30:33] Heights. I love recipes that have the names of the person they came from, which is so true.
[00:30:39] And then she said that she usually doesn't include the chives, which I think the chives sound
[00:30:43] delicious. So what makes these special sour cream, cream cheese, milk, butter, and chives,
[00:30:48] all the delicious things for potatoes. And she said, I also don't use lower fat versions of the
[00:30:54] ingredients. I figure it's once or twice a year, so I load them up. Did you say it was Bill's
[00:31:04] father's mashed potato recipe? Hazel's potatoes. I love it. Hazel's potatoes. Sounds delicious,
[00:31:14] right? Sounds really delicious. Very good. Well, I'm going to go from savory to sweet.
[00:31:20] okay our wonderful listener joellen she always has uh joellen joellen joellen joellen joellen
[00:31:28] we love you you're she's always commenting and she's so sweet thank you joellen yeah and she
[00:31:34] makes on christmas eve at that big appetizer party yes she's the one that has the dainty tray
[00:31:42] but it's the cookie tray and she makes cookies so i spoke with her and i just said
[00:31:48] joe tell me about when this started and she said when she moved out of her parents house
[00:31:53] she took the mixer oh and she told her mom i will make the cookies for christmas
[00:32:02] moving forward and she said her mom was said that's great great that is great and she said
[00:32:09] she's been doing it ever since and her trays are just lovely and i know she gives some like
[00:32:15] We talked about the nuts and bolts as gifts.
[00:32:19] Yes.
[00:32:20] This is probably multiple days, maybe into weeks.
[00:32:25] I not really sure She didn get into that But she said yeah she was making the cookies She makes chocolate chip and the peanut butter cookies And she makes crockpot candy
[00:32:35] She said she's been making that forever.
[00:32:37] And then she always likes to throw maybe one or two new ones.
[00:32:41] And she said she has a new one for this year coming up.
[00:32:44] But there is a recipe for potato chip cookies.
[00:32:49] And she said one of her landlords gave her the recipe.
[00:32:52] And it's been a favorite on that train.
[00:32:55] And she adds a little food coloring dye.
[00:32:57] So she'll have green and red ones.
[00:33:00] Wow.
[00:33:02] You know what?
[00:33:03] It's funny because I'm usually very hungry right when we get there because you travel, you drop your things off, you go to church as a family.
[00:33:11] I probably go to that sweet tray first when I get there when there's still all of this other yummy, savory foods for Christmas Eve.
[00:33:22] And so great. So thank you, Joellen. We love it.
[00:33:27] Oh my gosh, yes. That sounds wonderful. What a gift to bring to an event like that.
[00:33:35] Right, right.
[00:33:36] That's so nice.
[00:33:37] Please continue making the cookies.
[00:33:40] Yes, right. So you started off with the sweet treats and I'm going to carry on with that.
[00:33:46] So Karen, another one of our sweet listeners, she submitted almond paste cookies.
[00:33:52] And this is what she said.
[00:33:54] My grown daughter hates nuts, but she loves these cookies.
[00:33:59] I make these every year for Christmas as one of the must-haves for my holiday cookies.
[00:34:05] Cousins, aunts, and especially kids beg me to make these.
[00:34:08] My daughter and son actually have arguments about who I love more based on the number of almond paste cookies they get each year.
[00:34:17] They will actually steal from each other's cookie boxes to be sure they get enough of them.
[00:34:22] I've gone from doubling this recipe to tripling it because they're so popular.
[00:34:27] They're not hard to make, but they are time consuming.
[00:34:30] by the time I'm done they have gone from these petite half teaspoon sized cookies to a two inch
[00:34:36] blob because I want to be done with them and of course baking time changes when this happens
[00:34:42] then she added this sweet note I look forward to learning about some new yummy recipes from
[00:34:47] your podcast I'm sure you will have fun with this episode you both always have a good time
[00:34:53] hugs and blessings karen karen right and the very first ingredient is one pound or two cups of almond paste I don know that I ever even seen almond paste Almond paste So I need to look
[00:35:10] into this recipe. My mom has made an almond crescent cookie. Okay. And then you really
[00:35:16] douse them in powdered sugar. So I'm curious. I'd really want to take a peek at this recipe.
[00:35:22] Yeah. So while we're on the topic of sweet treats, Meg, my sister Deb, in addition to the nuts and bolts, she also submitted something I want to try making this year because I think that our girls might really like it. It's an M&M Christmas cookie bar. And she said it's her kid's favorite, her grown kids. They ask for it every year. It's basically cookie dough made into bars with the colorful Christmas M&Ms and white and milk chocolate chips.
[00:35:48] and I saw a picture of the recipe that she sent and they just look so festive and fun with the
[00:35:54] colorful M&Ms. So those look really, really good. And then my sweet friend Barb from back in
[00:36:01] Rochester. This one might make us both cry. She says her mom's Christmas tree loaves. I think that
[00:36:11] Barb's mom is in her 90s somewhere. She's amazing. She is such a lovely woman. She says,
[00:36:19] every year my mom would make these Christmas tree breads for our Christmas breakfast. She made them
[00:36:25] for many friends and my family. My sister memorialized the recipe one year by having
[00:36:32] it printed on a cloth for all of us. So it's almost, almost looks like a dish towel, but you
[00:36:37] would never use it for that because it's too special. It is still a favorite for all of us,
[00:36:42] especially Everest and McKinley. One year, my parents came to visit me in Chicago and my mom
[00:36:49] made six of them for me and my friends. When we went out to dinner one night, our dog Krista got
[00:36:57] into them and ate as many as she could and buried the rest of them in my white couches.
[00:37:03] oh that's not good not good no which actually reminds me of a story my sister barb and our
[00:37:14] friend laurie who was our next door neighbor at the time so we had made some desserts and we had
[00:37:20] set them out on the kitchen table to cool and we went over to laurie house for our visit and barbara had brought her two dogs and we had ollie and we had put a gate and kept all of them in the family room while little Coco was so agile she jumped right over the fence got up on the
[00:37:38] kitchen table and proceeded to eat all these desserts and of course it didn't sit very well
[00:37:45] in her tummy and so it was a very big mess when we got back but so watch out for those little pets
[00:37:51] when it's holiday cooking time, I guess. Definitely, definitely. Oh, how great. Yes,
[00:37:57] yes. And she actually sent a picture of the cloth with the recipe on it. And what's so sweet about
[00:38:05] it is that there's little dates written on the side with little notes. So also super sweet. So
[00:38:12] tell me what, tell me about what you love. Like what does your family love? For sure. I mean, I,
[00:38:17] This could run this into, you know, 10 hours.
[00:38:22] But speaking of kind of traditions from when I grew up, my mom would stop at the bakery, the Polish bakery, probably a day or two before Christmas Eve and pick up hoska.
[00:38:37] Oh, what's that?
[00:38:38] It's a braided bread, very brioche-like.
[00:38:42] Okay.
[00:38:43] And sometimes there's golden raisins and slivered almonds.
[00:38:48] Even the kids just could not wait.
[00:38:51] Once, we all had kids.
[00:38:53] So then she'd give each family a couple hoskas because we all wanted them.
[00:38:59] Slice it and then just munch on it for days after Christmas.
[00:39:04] My mom was just the most amazing cook, honestly.
[00:39:07] You'd rather have that than going to a restaurant because she really was a great cook.
[00:39:12] So her stuffing. And then for Thanksgiving, she always went to the turkey farm. She'd tell us, you know, we're going to, I think it was called Hoka, maybe, somewhere, maybe by you, actually.
[00:39:23] I think.
[00:39:24] Out, maybe that way. And they'd get a turkey. And she always had a specific size because she said if it's too large, it'll be dry. So they would get a couple. But then they would get legs, turkey legs.
[00:39:40] Okay.
[00:39:40] So every Thanksgiving, she'd have a whole huge tray of dark meat.
[00:39:47] Oh.
[00:39:48] Because dark meat was a little bit on our family's favorite.
[00:39:52] And it was just all smothered in this delicious gravy that she got from the turkey.
[00:39:59] I mean, she made it.
[00:40:00] eat it, but all of the ingredients were fresh from the turkey farm. Yeah, so so delicious.
[00:40:06] And then I was just talking to the kids about Christmas and Thanksgiving. And one year,
[00:40:11] my son just said, I think we should have mac and cheese for Thanksgiving because everything was
[00:40:15] very traditional. You know, everything was very traditional. And my dad, I can just hear him
[00:40:22] saying, mac and cheese, that doesn't go on Thanksgiving. And then I made it. I said,
[00:40:27] you know what, I'm making it. That became a favorite. So we've had that every year with
[00:40:32] everything else. So delicious. Yes. Well, if I can pop in there for a second. I want to hear.
[00:40:37] Because Jessica's a vegetarian. And so, you know, she doesn't do any of the meat dishes,
[00:40:43] obviously. But mac and cheese became one of her requests as well. And so it usually makes it
[00:40:49] onto our table as well. Now, question, do you make any crunchy toppings on the top?
[00:40:56] I have not.
[00:40:57] Okay, because my mom, we don't, because my mom used to crumble bacon on the top, which
[00:41:04] obviously for a vegetarian doesn't work out.
[00:41:06] But also she would take like saltine crackers and I think maybe crumble them up and mix
[00:41:11] them with a bit of butter and salt.
[00:41:13] She would sprinkle it on the top with the bacon on the top and then at the end kind
[00:41:17] of broil it for a bit and it would get this crispy topping on the top.
[00:41:21] So good.
[00:41:23] That sounds amazing.
[00:41:24] yes i've seen those and i don't know why i haven't tried that yeah well maybe you could do half and
[00:41:31] half oh not everybody would necessarily want that you know if ted likes it the way he likes it
[00:41:37] that's true okay so the next couple of recipes are from theresa in upstate new york and theresa's
[00:41:46] sharing a savory and a sweet well an appetizer and a sweet i guess so the first one is olive
[00:41:53] crostini toast. So it's a little appetizer. It looks delicious. You thinly slice a baguette and
[00:42:01] put the topping of the olive mixture on top and then a little cheese on top and it looks delicious.
[00:42:08] And Teresa shared a photo of the cookbook it came out of. It's a little tiny little thin cookbook
[00:42:14] and the pages are falling out. She says it's been well loved and I find that to be true of any
[00:42:20] cookbook that has been around for a while is that they're very well loved. They have
[00:42:24] stains on them and crumpled pages I don know maybe some people take better care of their cookbooks than I do but that how I know it a well cookbook And then her second recipe
[00:42:35] is a little bit of a different take on pumpkin pie. It's called pumpkin chiffon dessert.
[00:42:42] Oh my gosh, it looks delicious and it sounds delicious. I think it's quite light compared to
[00:42:48] like the dense pumpkin pie. And she said that there was a furniture store down on the Finger
[00:42:54] legs that used to send out newsletters, and that the pumpkin chiffon dessert was in the newsletter.
[00:43:00] So she tried it one year, and now it's her family's favorite. So thank you so much, Teresa,
[00:43:06] for sharing those recipes. We're going to include all the details of that. And then our daughter,
[00:43:12] Jessica, who's a vegetarian, he submitted a spicy potato soup recipe. And the little bit of backstory
[00:43:20] to potato soup is that my husband's father is an excellent cook and he makes a potato soup that is
[00:43:30] just outstanding. We request it every time we go back to Canada. And Jessica decided that she needed
[00:43:37] potato soup in her life because grandpa lives too far away. And so she found a recipe online that she
[00:43:44] made and she shared that with us. And of course, it actually, it's not just vegetarian, I believe
[00:43:49] it's vegan. The broth that she used is a vegan broth. So that will be included in our cookbook
[00:43:57] as well. So yeah, my favorite things to be on the table. So I came up with four, of course,
[00:44:03] there's many more. Rum cake, which I will include in our digital cookbook. It is so yummy, so moist.
[00:44:10] And I think it's probably Pete and my favorite. My mom's marshmallow fruit salad, which not
[00:44:16] Everybody loves.
[00:44:17] My sister Barb and I were talking about that because we were like, we love it, but none of our kids like it.
[00:44:21] Only Barb and I and our husbands like it.
[00:44:25] But yeah, it has to be on the table.
[00:44:28] I love it.
[00:44:29] And peanut butter and marshmallow squares.
[00:44:33] A dainty, I would say.
[00:44:35] Okay.
[00:44:35] So yummy.
[00:44:36] So definitely.
[00:44:39] Is that a no-bake?
[00:44:40] It's a no-bake.
[00:44:42] Okay.
[00:44:43] Yeah, it's a no-bake.
[00:44:44] Like you have to melt stuff, but you don't have to put anything in the oven.
[00:44:47] So, yeah, it's really, really tasty.
[00:44:49] It's a good one.
[00:44:50] But those when you can cut into teeny little bites you going to probably eat a bunch of them but they pretty rich So yeah And then I have stuffing on my lips too but I don do anything fancy like what you do I think I need to Well tell me Oh no
[00:45:05] I'm a stove-tub stuffing girl.
[00:45:08] But it's tradition and that's the flavor.
[00:45:11] Yeah, because then when you try something else and it doesn't taste the way you think it should taste.
[00:45:16] Yes.
[00:45:17] No, that's great.
[00:45:19] I love that.
[00:45:19] Well, that being said, Meg, please feel free to share if you want to make some stuffing and send it my way. I'm happy to taste test it.
[00:45:28] Oh, gosh, it is amazing. And just a couple other ones that my kids reminded me of.
[00:45:34] Every year since they were little, Gib makes candy cane pancakes on Christmas Eve breakfast.
[00:45:42] Oh, my gosh, what is a candy cane pancake?
[00:45:44] So Gibb would make pancakes, but he'd give Ziploc baggies of little candy canes to the kids.
[00:45:52] Yeah.
[00:45:52] To chop.
[00:45:53] Yeah.
[00:45:54] Smash them up.
[00:45:55] Yep.
[00:45:55] Smash them up.
[00:45:56] And then think of elf, you know, syrup, candy canes.
[00:46:01] This year, we'll hopefully do it again.
[00:46:03] And then Christmas morning, I always make quiche.
[00:46:07] Oh, yum.
[00:46:08] Kind of when we're up and we're just all gathering.
[00:46:11] Yeah.
[00:46:12] I just, I'm up early, but then it goes in the oven and you can smell it while we're just saying good morning and stuff.
[00:46:19] So those are two things, just the four plus Marianne, because she's usually with us, we've enjoyed.
[00:46:26] Nice.
[00:46:27] For as long as I can remember.
[00:46:29] Yeah, my sister Deb does a dish called Wife Saver.
[00:46:33] And I think it's called that because it's similar.
[00:46:35] You toss it in the oven and it's, you know, baking while the Christmas morning is getting started.
[00:46:40] But yeah, I think it's bread and eggs and breakfast casserole and called Wife Saver, which I think that is funny.
[00:46:49] But yeah, that's on her list, too.
[00:46:53] And for us on Christmas morning, I kind of started this little tradition just a few years ago.
[00:46:59] But we all love Panera Bread cinnamon crunch bagels with hazelnut cream cheese.
[00:47:06] So I pick some of those up the day before you can order them.
[00:47:10] You'd have to order them.
[00:47:12] You'd have to order them.
[00:47:13] And specifically the hazelnut cream cheese.
[00:47:16] And we have those in the morning, usually with just some scrambled eggs and some fruit.
[00:47:21] That's kind of, it's nothing fancy, but everybody loves cinnamon crunch bagels.
[00:47:25] So that what we get That is so fun Yeah And speaking of Panera because Christmas Eve lunch because we would separate families you know I always invited our parents and Gibbs dad for lunch before we would go our separate ways for beef barley soup
[00:47:43] So I'd order Panera's cheesy bread and also their bread bowls.
[00:47:49] Oh, yes. Yes. That's a great idea.
[00:47:52] Not everybody wants the bread bowl.
[00:47:54] I just want a bowl of soup with bread on the side.
[00:47:57] But for sure, Gib and Julia always wanted that bread bowl because then you can, it's so good.
[00:48:03] Oh, and beef barley soup was my dad's favorite, my family's favorite.
[00:48:07] My mom was always very sweet because she'd say, you know, you're doing a good job taking it over.
[00:48:14] Because she always made it too.
[00:48:15] And she'd give me a pat on the back saying, this is really good.
[00:48:19] So, yeah, that's a family favorite, too.
[00:48:22] This has been so fun.
[00:48:23] It has been so fun.
[00:48:25] I can literally hear the bells and the Christmas music playing behind American Thanksgiving is coming up as well.
[00:48:32] So I wore my red sweater to be festive today.
[00:48:36] You are festive.
[00:48:38] Let me see those earrings.
[00:48:41] Oh, they're kind of, they look a little snowman.
[00:48:42] Oh, I like them.
[00:48:44] They're very pretty.
[00:48:45] And so we're recording this fairly early in November.
[00:48:51] Today is November 9th.
[00:48:54] And I have to tell you that my sister Deb, who lives in Canada, so their Thanksgiving is long past, is setting up her Christmas decorations today.
[00:49:03] She is.
[00:49:04] Yes!
[00:49:05] And I was like, well, that's early.
[00:49:07] But we were driving yesterday to visit some friends and we saw some people with their Christmas trees and their lights and everything, not just up, but on.
[00:49:15] And I was like, OK.
[00:49:17] Well, their Thanksgiving is passed because kind of our family rule is right after Thanksgiving, we can decorate.
[00:49:25] So in her credit.
[00:49:28] Yes.
[00:49:29] If she's going by that rule.
[00:49:31] Yes.
[00:49:32] Good.
[00:49:33] But I have seen the Christmas decorations.
[00:49:34] When do you decorate?
[00:49:35] It really depends what's happening at our house. If we're having Christmas at our house, I start a little bit earlier.
[00:49:43] And I might start setting up things on the inside even before Thanksgiving.
[00:49:48] This year we're traveling to my sister's house, so hard to say what I'll do.
[00:49:52] But when we lived in Rochester, it was like day after Thanksgiving, bing, everybody's decorations came on.
[00:50:00] All their lights came on.
[00:50:01] Turn the lights on.
[00:50:01] Yeah, and I'm scrambling like, oh, my gosh, I forgot again.
[00:50:05] You know, every year was the same.
[00:50:06] But I was like, oh, I've got to hurry up and get my lights up and all that stuff.
[00:50:10] All right, I have a few questions for you then.
[00:50:12] Yeah.
[00:50:13] Do you do multiple trees?
[00:50:15] I do two trees.
[00:50:17] I have a large tree that we put in our family room.
[00:50:20] And then I have my angel tree that I started when my mom passed away.
[00:50:25] And with a photo of mom on there, and it's my gold tree.
[00:50:29] There's only gold ornaments on there.
[00:50:31] And now my dad's on the tree as well.
[00:50:33] So that's our angel tree.
[00:50:35] And this year I ordered from my sister Barbara a big bow to put on the top.
[00:50:40] So I'm actually really excited to see that.
[00:50:43] She sent it to me.
[00:50:44] It's beautiful.
[00:50:45] And I can't wait to add that.
[00:50:46] And it's kind of extra special that she made it.
[00:50:49] And it's going on the angel tree with our mom and dad's pictures on there.
[00:50:53] So, yeah.
[00:50:54] That is extra special.
[00:50:56] Goes into our blue room.
[00:50:58] Blue room.
[00:50:59] Oh, with the gold tree. So pretty. Oh, I can picture that since I've been over there. That's pretty. Now, what about what are some of your other favorite decorating pieces for the holidays?
[00:51:12] Well, I love to make a fancy table.
[00:51:15] I would rather make a fancy table than have to cook.
[00:51:18] I've mentioned that before.
[00:51:19] So I love to layer it up with all the charger and the plates and the candles.
[00:51:25] And I bring out the good dishes.
[00:51:28] I love to have any excuse to use good dishes.
[00:51:31] I got that from my mother.
[00:51:33] We both really love pretty dishes.
[00:51:35] So that's a must do.
[00:51:37] And then I probably mostly focus the rest of the decorations on the mantel and in the entryway out on the front step, but also in the foyer.
[00:51:48] Now tell me, do you have lights everywhere too? Twinkly lights?
[00:51:52] I put twinkle lights, of course, on the trees and then on the mantel because I do garland on the mantel and twinkle lights on the console table.
[00:52:01] one year I tried that um it was it was kind of going viral for a bit it's like the tension rod
[00:52:08] so a tension rod obviously you can put it up anywhere in a doorway or between two walls that
[00:52:14] are close enough together and you wrap the garland and the lights around and you add whatever
[00:52:19] and one year I did that in the entryway and it was pretty but I kept worrying it was gonna fall
[00:52:23] down right but that sounds very fun and festive I like that it was pretty and one year I did it We have a little window seat in our kitchen and I put it up there but I used real greenery
[00:52:39] And as it got dry, it would just, every time you went by it, it would just rain those needles down.
[00:52:44] And I thought, yeah, this is why you don't use this.
[00:52:47] Don't shake it at all. Right. Oh, geez.
[00:52:51] Now, do you do only white lights or do you have multicolor?
[00:52:55] No, I'm a white lights girl. How about you?
[00:52:59] Right now, I would prefer white lights. I mean, if there is a string of multicolor in our decorating box, I probably would still plug them in and use them somewhere.
[00:53:12] Right.
[00:53:12] But I'd probably, yeah, just the white. Oh, so pretty.
[00:53:17] It's so pretty and it's just so romantic. And there's something about the white twinkle lights I just love.
[00:53:23] The colored lights are so fun. And when our girls were little, of course, they wanted colored lights. But there's something about the white lights that I just love. Because then when Christmas is over, it's still just this nice glow. You can even keep them up for a little bit. Just feel so cozy in the house with the white twinkle lights. So that's what I like.
[00:53:42] Do you keep your table that you will, you know, use the charger and the best step set?
[00:53:51] Or is that just when you're serving?
[00:53:55] So for Thanksgiving, if we're having Thanksgiving, usually I would set it the night before.
[00:54:00] Okay.
[00:54:01] And it'll just be for dinner.
[00:54:02] And then same for Christmas.
[00:54:04] It's usually just for dinner time.
[00:54:06] And so then I have to make sure that I can roll the tablecloth back so my husband can
[00:54:10] eat breakfast and lunch without messing up my table yes okay very important step there yes
[00:54:18] because we do not have a specific dining room in this house well your table works perfectly i know
[00:54:24] that you mentioned the viral tension rod the one that i started a couple years ago i saw a cute
[00:54:31] video i think on instagram she used big wide gauzy ribbon you know you can buy it at michael's
[00:54:41] or hobby lobby and i wrapped the door the front door yeah and then just added and wasn't perfect
[00:54:50] like a lot of people do one of twig and vines bows would be wonderful in the center of that Oh sure But that was really fun because it really looked pretty Yes you could still open and close the door like normal And yeah that was a fun one Do you do anything on your door
[00:55:07] besides a wreath or do you even do a wreath? Yeah, I do a wreath on the front door and we have some
[00:55:15] urns and little topiary balls that we put lights on. And sometimes I'll tie bows around the urns.
[00:55:21] So yeah, usually I've got some little light up gifts that are just cute that I might put in the front.
[00:55:29] I have put lights around the front area before.
[00:55:32] Outside.
[00:55:33] Yeah, outside.
[00:55:34] But I don't do the whole house because, as I mentioned, my husband doesn't like to do that.
[00:55:38] And so I would have to do it all myself and it's just a little much.
[00:55:41] So I just concentrate on just the front entry, which is enough.
[00:55:45] You know, it's enough.
[00:55:45] It is.
[00:55:46] Yeah.
[00:55:46] It is.
[00:55:47] You know what one of my favorite things to look at is?
[00:55:51] are your planters that you use for summer with the white what are what is that yeah like the
[00:56:00] branch the branches that look like snow on them yes very then the red berries and yes that's very
[00:56:07] those are so pretty and I do love to add the green swags the greenery swags with bows on all of my
[00:56:16] coach lights outside the house. So either side of the garage and either side of the house,
[00:56:22] I do like to add those there. When we had a staircase, I would put them on the staircase.
[00:56:26] We don't have a staircase in this house because it's a ranch. So now I put them on the coach
[00:56:32] lights. I love them there. Putting one out on the lamppost or a wreath out on your lamppost,
[00:56:37] if you have a yard light, that's really pretty too. So there's no end to the beautiful things
[00:56:41] you can do, right? One more question about the decorating then. Do you have specific,
[00:56:48] you know, winter holiday pillows and blankets that you switch out? I do have some actually.
[00:56:56] The blankets, I like the faux fur blankets. So the white or off-white faux fur blankets,
[00:57:01] that's what I like. So we've got several of them around. So I don't get into color with those.
[00:57:07] And we also have some faux fur pillows that I put behind.
[00:57:11] But then I did get some cute holiday pillows.
[00:57:14] And I think they say joy on them.
[00:57:16] And they've got a tiny bit of red in them.
[00:57:18] But they're pretty neutral because that's my taste that I like.
[00:57:22] So my tree even the big tree is mostly gold white or off And then little sprinkles of red in there just a tiny bit So it quite a traditional tree but that what I like I like the traditional
[00:57:37] You accumulated ornaments throughout the year, or do you just have it as you use the gold?
[00:57:44] Definitely accumulated ornaments over the year from way back, let's see, early 90s,
[00:57:51] when I first started teaching kindergarten, a lot of the kids, you know, obviously probably their
[00:57:57] moms or their parents would pick an ornament and give it. So some of them even have the kids' names
[00:58:02] underneath, you know, on the bottom. And so that's super sweet. And, you know, the girls would have
[00:58:09] their favorite ornaments. So Jessica went through the ballet phase where she had all these little
[00:58:13] ballerina figurines. So that's in a box for Jessica. Occasionally I might put one on the tree,
[00:58:19] but those are really hers. And then Jordan, the animal lover, she had every, you know, little
[00:58:24] animal with a Santa hat on, you know, so those are super cute too. So definitely an accumulation
[00:58:31] of ornaments over time. And I love finding, it doesn't even matter what it is, if it catches my
[00:58:38] attention and it's something that I think would bring a little joy on the tree, I'll pick it up
[00:58:42] and put it on the tree. But I have a lot of ornaments, so I don't really need a lot of
[00:58:45] Right. So it has to be pretty special to make it into the cart.
[00:58:50] Well, when will the girls take their box for their own?
[00:58:55] You know, that's a great question. They actually both now live in one bedroom apartment, so they
[00:59:00] might decide to do that. I'm not sure. I can imagine for them maybe a tabletop tree.
[00:59:06] But as I say that, I'm thinking of Jessica's two kittens, and I don't think it would last.
[00:59:12] So she might want to wait on that.
[00:59:14] okay yeah and even jordan's little puppy jordan had some lights that she had hung up and they
[00:59:23] hung down a little bit down the wall and little miss cleo got a hold of them and chomped them up
[00:59:29] so yeah they might be a ways from okay okay so fun yeah this has been amazing how about your kids
[00:59:38] yeah they have a box last year they both got trees because we are with them for thanksgiving
[00:59:44] Oh, fun.
[00:59:45] And was it the day after Thanksgiving? We had a great day. We went to Home Depot. It was freezing out. I remember it was so cold.
[00:59:53] And the Home Depot in the city, you know, the city, it's not long and wide. The Home Depot was amazing.
[01:00:00] Sure.
[01:00:00] You know.
[01:00:01] So the rooftop was the tree farm.
[01:00:05] Okay.
[01:00:06] So we went up there.
[01:00:07] Julie wanted a real tree.
[01:00:08] So she picked one out and she got a box.
[01:00:10] I think they were gold.
[01:00:11] Box of gold ornaments.
[01:00:13] But we have a box for her too.
[01:00:15] And Teddy did pick out a really cute one.
[01:00:17] It's tall and skinny and an artificial and plugged in.
[01:00:22] We put it together.
[01:00:23] We went to each of their apartments.
[01:00:25] Super fun.
[01:00:26] So fun.
[01:00:27] Speaking of Joellen, every year she gives gifts to all the nieces.
[01:00:32] And it's the, pardon me if I'm pronouncing this wrong, the Swarovski?
[01:00:38] Swarovski or something?
[01:00:39] Yeah, something like that.
[01:00:40] The crystal.
[01:00:41] Yes.
[01:00:42] And it's the ornament of the year.
[01:00:44] Oh, nice.
[01:00:45] So each of the nieces are nephews.
[01:00:49] So I think Julia has 24 or 23 of them.
[01:00:54] Teddy has.
[01:00:55] Wow.
[01:00:55] So it's been tradition that just at the top of our tree, it's just this crystal tree.
[01:01:03] It's so pretty.
[01:01:04] So they're going to get their ornaments.
[01:01:08] So they have a big box.
[01:01:10] But yes, and then a few of the ones that they've gotten from their sports are very fun.
[01:01:15] Yeah.
[01:01:16] Well, I love that.
